## 📝 Overview

Welcome to the **Data Engineering Pipeline Project**! This project aims to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes for [insert specific use case or dataset]. The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently and provides insights through automated reporting and analysis.

### 🔗 Key Features
- **Scalability**: Built to handle increasing data loads seamlessly.
- **Robustness**: Designed with error handling and logging to ensure reliability.
- **Automation**: Fully automated data workflows using [insert tools or frameworks, e.g., Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka].
- **Visualization**: Integrates with [insert visualization tools, e.g., Tableau, Power BI] for data analysis.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **Data Extraction**: [Insert tools, e.g., Apache Spark, Python scripts]
- **Data Transformation**: [Insert tools, e.g., Pandas, Dask]
- **Data Loading**: [Insert tools, e.g., AWS S3, Google BigQuery]
- **Workflow Orchestration**: [Insert tools, e.g., Apache Airflow]
- **Version Control**: [Insert tools, e.g., Git, GitHub]

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/data-engineering-pipeline.git
   cd data-engineering-pipeline
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration variables:
   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To run the data pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 🔄 Scheduling with Apache Airflow

You can schedule the pipeline using Apache Airflow. To start the Airflow server, run:

```bash
airflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
```

## 📈 Visualization

After the pipeline runs, you can access the data in [insert database or storage location, e.g., AWS S3]. Use [insert visualization tool] to create reports and dashboards.
